 In this Guess the Number game I played a little with the js functions, and I got more in control about the understanding of the code 
the debugging and the defragmentation to understand and solve the possible problem. This game can be found here - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash and it was a fun little project to understand and rebuild.
